## Towards Interpretable Solar Flare Prediction with Attention-based Deep Neural Networks
In this work, we developed an attention-based deep learning model as an improvement over the standard CNN pipeline to perform full-disk binary flare predictions for the occurrence of â‰¥M1.0-class flares within the next 24 hours.
